**WordPress Website Deployment Guide**

This guide will walk you through the steps required to deploy a WordPress website to a production environment. We will cover the necessary configurations, dependencies, and deployment process to ensure a smooth and successful deployment.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

A web server: You need a web server like Apache or Nginx installed and properly configured.
PHP and MySQL: Install PHP and MySQL on your server to support WordPress.
Domain and DNS: Obtain a domain name and configure the DNS settings to point to your server's IP address.
FTP or SSH access: Ensure you have FTP or SSH access to your web server.

**Step 1: Download WordPress**

Visit the official WordPress website (https://wordpress.org) and download the latest stable release.
Extract the WordPress archive to a local directory on your computer.

**Step 2: Configure the Database**

Create a new MySQL database for your WordPress installation.
Create a MySQL user and grant it appropriate privileges for the database.
Note down the database name, username, and password for later use.

**Step 3: Configure WordPress**

Rename the wp-config-sample.php file in the WordPress directory to wp-config.php.
Open wp-config.php in a text editor and update the following database settings:
DB_NAME: Set this to the name of the MySQL database you created.
DB_USER: Set this to the MySQL username.
DB_PASSWORD: Set this to the MySQL user's password.
DB_HOST: Set this to the hostname or IP address of the MySQL server.
Save the changes to wp-config.php.

**Step 4: Upload WordPress to the Server**

Connect to your server via FTP or SSH.
Navigate to the document root directory of your web server (e.g., /var/www/html).
Upload the entire WordPress directory to the document root directory.

**Step 5: Set File Permissions**

Change the ownership of the WordPress files to the web server user (e.g., www-data) using the appropriate command for your server environment.
Set the file permissions of directories to 755 and files to 644, recursively within the WordPress directory.

**Step 6: Complete Installation**

Open a web browser and visit your domain name.
You will be prompted to complete the WordPress installation.
Provide the required information, including your website title, admin username, password, and email.
Click "Install WordPress" to complete the installation.

**Step 7: Secure Your Installation**

Delete the wp-config-sample.php file from the server.
Install a security plugin (e.g., Wordfence or Sucuri) to enhance the security of your WordPress installation.
Keep your WordPress installation, themes, and plugins up to date to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Step 8: Optional Steps**

Choose and install a theme for your website.
Install plugins to extend the functionality of your website.
Configure any additional settings or customizations as per your requirements.


**Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your WordPress website. Ensure to regularly back up your website and perform routine maintenance to keep it secure and up to date.
